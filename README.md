- Project1
  - FIFO Pipe
    > We implemented a FIFO pipe to be used as a means of communication between two threads
  - Parallel Fractal Computation
    > We parallelized the Mandelbrot set fractal algorithm
  - Parallel Quicksort Algorithm
    > We parallelized the Quicksort algorithm
- Project2
  > We implemented a binary semaphore library using [pthread mutexes]. Then, we used it to achieve thread synchronization in three problems:
  > - the Parallel Fractal Computation Problem
  > - the Single-Lane Bridge Problem
  > - the Roller Coaster Problem
- Project3
  > We implemented a Conditional Critical Regions (CCR) library using [pthread mutexes] and [pthread conditional variables].
  > Then, we reassessed the three synchronization problems from Project2 using:
  > - pthread conditional variables
  > - our CCR library 
- Project4
  > We implemented an interpreter for a simple programming language that supports basic arithmetic operations between variables, as well as load, store, branch and jump operations.
  > Moreover, we extended the execution environment in order to support multithreading. We also implemented semaphores, so that multiple programs running concurrently can be synchronized.
